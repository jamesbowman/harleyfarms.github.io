This year we have many all-white kids. Our youngest buck, Bob, is a Saanen, a creamy-white breed with peaceful manners. He has obviously been quite popular with the ladies.

We bottle-feed the newborns for a few days with pasteurized goat milk, until they learn to suckle from teats on buckets of milk. They need strong muscles to suckle, and the Corona bottles are the ideal shape to provide some resistance to the flow so that they develop those muscles.

After they feed, the babies fluff up their fur. You can look into a pen of babies and tell who has just fed.

Then they shiver all over, in a milky ecstasy. The pleasure of food.
