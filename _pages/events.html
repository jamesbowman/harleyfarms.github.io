        ### Farm dinners and luncheons

        We cook dinner for you at least twice a month. These are real farm dinners, prepared from local food by our farm cook, served by candlelight. Pescadero is a nexus of farming on the central Californian coast. Fourth-generation sprout, leek and artichoke farmers, grass-fed beef and lamb and whey-fed pork, organic greens, grains and wheat are all here.

        We release next year's dinner dates at midnight on October 31st. Sign up for our newsletter if you would like a reminder. Poss to make a sign up here?

        Our special event dinners and luncheons include a May Day lunch and parade, British Bonfire Night, and Harvest Festival. See more
