  <h1>Tours</h1>
  <p class="intro">
    Get up close with the goats. Our lovely guides will take you through the
    edible garden into the pasture, loafing barn and milking parlor, with a
    peek at cheesemaking in the dairy. <br> Book a private tour for your group,
    or take a public tour in spring and summer.
  </p>
  <p class="intro">
    <!-- <b>Next Tour: February 2020 -->
    <!-- Or just drop in during open hours (Friday-Sunday 11am-4pm) - you are welcome to visit without booking a tour. -->
  </p>
  <p class="intro">
    <b>Or just drop in</b> any time Friday through Sunday 11am-4pm -
    say hello to the goats and donkeys over the fence, taste all the cheese and goodies in the shop, and check out the view from the hayloft balcony. Bring a picnic if you'd like - there are tables next to the hay barn.
