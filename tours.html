    <!-- Farm tour booking is closed for the moment. We will open booking as soon as we can. <br> If you already have a booking, you will be able to reschedule. -->

    New longer tours take you further into the farm. You'll see our milking herd, guardian dogs and puppies, donkeys and Gentleman Jim the alpaca, not to mention the bees and the peacocks. Bring your walking shoes and your mask. We'll stay outside apart from a look in the hayloft, in smaller groups of just ten or fewer. Enjoy your take-home box of two farmstead cheeses.
