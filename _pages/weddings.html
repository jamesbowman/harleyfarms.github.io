        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Your romantic, rustic dream</h2>

        A deeply romantic, relaxed and intimate destination for your perfect
        day. We have the space and privacy for your romantically rustic dream -
        a woodland dell of mature oak and fairytale lichens, a hidden garden of
        roses, hydrangeas, bucolic bridge and winding paths. Our folk art
        furniture, full table service, wood fires and farm posies are yours.
        You are welcomed to our family farm with our goats and other animals
        for an intimate evening - yours is the only event of the night.

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">We take care of the details</h3>

        We are your event planner — we can even be your mother-in-law. There
        will be nothing for you to do, other than to bring the wine, and a
        priest or rabbi if you like. Drop off the wine a couple of days
        beforehand, get your hair done — and relax. There is really no need for
        a separate wedding planning service. Of course, we would be delighted
        to work with your planner, although we make an additional charge of
        $2000.
