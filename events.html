        <h3>Private dinners</h3>
        <p>
          Real food on a real farm. Host a dinner with us. Your party will meet
          the goats, nibble hors d’oeuvres in the garden, and unwind as dusk
          falls over the fields with local foods served by candlelight in our
          hayloft. Listen to the barn owls from the balcony and know that this
          is the life. Twenty seats. Email us at

        <h3>Team offsites</h3>
        <p>
          Getting here feels like the beginning of a holiday, but it’s not far
          at all. Getting something done while you’re here is going to be fun,
          because you’re meeting in the serene space of a private barn on a
          working farm. We can greet you with breakfast, sustain you with
          luncheon, and/or reward you with a farm dinner. Did I mention the
          goats? Meet the goats on a tour, which comes with cheese tasting.
