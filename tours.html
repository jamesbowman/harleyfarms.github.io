    <!-- Farm tour booking is closed for the moment. We will open booking as soon as we can. <br> If you already have a booking, you will be able to reschedule. -->

    New longer tours take you further into the farm. You'll see our milking herd, the newborn babies in spring, guardian dogs and British White cattle, not to mention the bees and the peacocks. Bring your walking shoes and your mask. Small groups of just ten or fewer. Enjoy your take-home button of farmstead cheese.

  <h2>Tours FAQ</h2>

      No, pop in any day between 11am and 4pm to say hello to the goats and donkeys over the fence.

    <div class="faq">
      Do we have to pay full price for our toddler?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      We think wandering around the farm by yourselves is more fun for little ones.
      We have information boards dotted around the farm and a pen with goats (sometimes puppies, or Iz the pig) that are easy to see and touch over the fence. Rosie, our donkey, loves a back scratch, and there are barn kitties around too.
      Farm tours involve a walk of just over a mile with plenty of talking, and tickets are $55/individual.

    <div class="faq">
      Do you have family tours?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Very young children would like our Family Tours, every Saturday at 11.30am in spring.

      if you would like to book a private family tour
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      Your tours are sold out but can we join one?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Sorry. We are keeping tour numbers low for safety.
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      Are tours suitable for people with limited mobility?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      We would be delighted to make special arrangements for you in advance so that you can see as much of the farm as possible. Send us a <a href="mailto:events@harleyfarms.com">message</a> before you visit. The tour involves soft uneven ground and may not be easy for all. We do not offer tractor rides.
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      Can we bring our dog?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Your dog is welcome in the pond area on a leash. Do not bring your dog inside the farm gate or near the goats. Our Anatolian shepherds are trained to react to potential threats to the goats. Please pick up after your dog.
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      Can we picnic on the farm?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      We do have picnic tables around the pond for you; we greatly appreciate your support of the farm in purchasing tours and food from our farm shop.
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      Can we book a tour just for us?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      We would love to <a href="mailto:events@harleyfarms.com">arrange</a> a private tour for you.
