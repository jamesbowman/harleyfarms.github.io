We began farming with six pet goats. All the girls had names and we
loved them. As the farm grew, we didn’t name all the goats. The new
generations were not pets, they were our milking herd. We got into the
rhythm of life and death and rebirth. Every birthing season brings the
thrill of new life, and it’s still a thrill, even though it is an
exhausting two months of work.

It might not sound evident, but babies with special needs lighten our
workload in spring. Just concentrating on their care takes the cloud of
exhaustion away. Nekkie was one of twins born to one of our experienced
milkers this March. She was motionless. I laid her aside on the straw
and fed her twin and the morning’s other births. When I returned to
her body, I saw a limb twitch. I picked her up, to find that her neck
was dislocated. But she was alive!

We are so fortunate in Pescadero to have a tightly knit community. My
neighbor Pattie took over. Pattie took the baby to a veterinarian and
collected a neck brace. She massaged the baby’s neck muscles. And
Nekkie recovered, so much so that she returned to her peer group of
babies within the week, thanks to Pattie. My favorite kid of the year!
