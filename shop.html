  <h1>Farm Shop</h1>
  <p class="intro">
  Picnic on the farm or take home a souvenir of Pescadero. The farm shop is in
  the old dairy stables, with horse hoof grooves in the floor. Ask our staff
  for a taste of anything you fancy and stock your pantry with some farm-made
  goodness.

        <h3>Cheese</h3>
        <p>
          We make farmstead dairy cheese, which is cheese from animals raised on
          our farm. It does not get better than this, which is why the chevre
          with herbs and flowers holds a World Gold Medal.
