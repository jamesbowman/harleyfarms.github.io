        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Tour the farm</h2>

        Harley Farms is open for farm tours and events in our atmospheric restored hayloft and larger private barns. Tours feature our goats and their guardian llamas on pasture and inside their loafing barn and milking parlor. Bring farm-ready footwear and be prepared to be nibbled!

        Tour our cheeses in the Cheese Shop at the dairy, which features our award-winning ricotta, feta, chevre and fromage blanc, with jellies, jams, spices and herb oils from the farm kitchen. There are local farm eggs and honey, and plenty of souvenir farm clothing.

        Weekend tours begin at 11am and Friday tours at 1pm, for two hours. Limited parking; no pets on the farm.

        You may book a weekend tour by clicking on the button below. For private or school tours, please contact us at <a href="mailto:events@harleyfarms.com">events@harleyfarms.com</a>; please book well in advance.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">What can I do if I'm not with a tour group?</h2>

        Visitors are welcome to stroll into the farm to see goats, llamas and Rosie the donkey in paddocks and pastures. We are open Thursday-Monday 11am to 4pm most of the year, and Friday-Sunday 11am to 4pm in January and February. In the spring, we usually have a group of lively babies in Tony's Pen. Don't miss the hayloft, where you'll see our magnificent fir table and carved folk chairs for hosting parties and farm dinners. Taste our award-winning ricotta, feta, chevre and fromage blanc cheeses, and take home a souvenir from our chic line of goat milk soaps and lotions. Make a picnic basket and relax at the tables near Rosie's pen.

            ### Weekend family visits

            We encourage your unscheduled visits with the family. Enjoy wandering the main farm corral to watch the babies in kidding season, and check out our edible flower gardens and hayloft. Tony's Pen is an enclosure in the main farm corral, where we keep a group of boisterous baby goats in the spring. There are picnic tables in the field near the donkey pen, with plenty of space for your frisky small companions.
