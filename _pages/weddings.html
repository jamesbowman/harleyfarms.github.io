        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Your romantic, rustic dream</h2>

        A deeply romantic, relaxed and intimate destination for your perfect day. We have the space and privacy for your romantically rustic dream — a woodland dell of mature oak and fairytale lichens, a hidden garden of roses, hydrangeas, bucolic bridge and winding paths. Our folk art furniture, full table service, wood fires and farm posies are yours. You are welcomed to our family farm with our goats and other animals for an intimate evening — yours is the only event of the night.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">We take care of the details</h2>

        We are your event planner - we can even be your mother-in-law. There will be nothing for you to do, other than to bring the wine, and a priest or rabbi if you like. Drop off the wine a couple of days beforehand, get your hair done — and relax. There is really no need for a separate wedding planning service. Of course, we would be delighted to work with your planner, although we make an additional charge of $2000.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Add these extra finishing touches</h2>

Set your rustic theme with invitations printed with our farm typeface. Set the wedding table with labeled Harley Farms favors - guests take home their own cheeses, jams, goat milk soap or carved jumpy goat. Add bohemian flower head wreaths for you and the bridesmaids.

You'll have many more family dinners in your future; begin them in style and comfort with us. Up to 40 guests.
